Priority of Things to do:

1. Can add posts in the past and i dont like tight the format for the tripTime is

2. Discuss if we want to edit profile information
    - I think no, info should be locked but see what others think
    - wont be difficult to implement anyway

3. My Postings 
    Should be two pages, driver trips and passenger trips, both available 
    on the navbar

    DRIVER TRIPS

    - Upcoming Trips
        - NOTI FOR UPCOMING DRIVER TRIPS
    - Past trips that need action 
        - NOTI IF THESE EXIST
        - Two options:
            1. mark as complete -> tripComplete workflow
            2. trip did not occur -> tripCancelled workflow
    - Past trips (no action needed)

    PASSENGER TRIPS

    - Upcoming Trips
        - Approved Passenger
            - NOTI FOR UPCOMING APPROVED PASSENGER TRIPS
        - Messaged Post owner
    - Past Trips as Approved Passenger


4. Posting management functionality for post owners 
    - flipping states isCancelled and isComplete and their consequences
    - changing numAvailableSeats and the consequence to the state isOpen
    - changing trip information and notifying users through messages
    - do we want to let post owners be able to modify approved passengers
      list thru here or just thru conversations???

5. Removing urself from the approvedPassenger list and its consequences

6. Fix back bug regarding logout and delete account
    - rn users can hit back and it will appear they are logged in
      but their session is deleted and therefore if they try and
      do anything an error arises saying session does not exist

7. When functionality is complete and webiste has been style Cole and I will 
   engineer test cases (this is because I implemented the system so I know it
   best and Cole helped design it so he has some knowledge). Test Cases will 
   be entered into Jira with detailed steps and intended result. Devon and 
   Goutham will then decide who does which test cases, then I will show them
   how to do the test cases, mark them as complete in Jira if there are no 
   issues and list issues if there are any.
