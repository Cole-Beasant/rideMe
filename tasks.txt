Priority of Things to do:

1. Fix trip date field bug on addPosting form 

2. Fix approvedPassenger create after discussing w othman

3. Discuss if we want to edit profile information
    - I think no, info should be locked but see what others think
    - wont be difficult to implement anyway

4. My Postings page
    I think it should look like this:

    UPCOMING TRIPS (these will be trips where posting.tripDate is in the future)

    - My owned postings
    - Postings where I am approved passenger
    - Postings where I messaged the post owner

    (note the different states of postings, isOpen, isCancelled, and isComplete
     and discuss how these states may affect this query)

    PAST TRIPS (if not upcoming, then its in the past)
    - My owned postings
    - Postings where I am approved passenger
    - Postings where I messaged the post owner

    (note the different states of postings, isOpen, isCancelled, and isComplete
     and discuss how these states may affect this query)

5. Posting management functionality for post owners 
    - flipping states isCancelled and isComplete and their consequences
    - changing numAvailableSeats and the consequence to the state isOpen
    - changing trip information and notifying users through messages

6. Removing urself from the approvedPassenger list and its consequences
    
7. Maybe add some built in functionality that automatically closes and completes 
   a trip after the trip date
    - need to discuss tho as what if the driver bailed and the trip didnt actually
      happen

8. Fix back bug regarding logout and delete account
    - rn users can hit back and it will appear they are logged in
      but their session is deleted and therefore if they try and
      do anything an error arises saying session does not exist
