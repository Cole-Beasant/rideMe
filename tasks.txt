Priority of Things to do:

1. Can add posts in the past and i dont like tight the format for the tripTime is
    - nbd that can add trips in the past, as they wont show up on the open postings
      and they will be deleted once u query my driver postings as if past postings dont
      have approved passengers, they r tossed once queried

2. Discuss if we want to edit profile information
    - I think no, info should be locked but see what others think
    - wont be difficult to implement anyway
    - should we add to profile number of trips cancelled??
    - this will also punish adding past trips more cuz it ends up
      cancelling it


3. Posting management functionality for post owners 
    - do we want to let post owners be able to modify approved passengers
      list thru here or just thru conversations???

4. Fix back bug regarding logout and delete account
    - rn users can hit back and it will appear they are logged in
      but their session is deleted and therefore if they try and
      do anything an error arises saying session does not exist

5. When functionality is complete and webiste has been styled and pushed to 
   the world wide web, Cole and I will engineer test cases (this is because 
   I implemented the system so I know it best and Cole helped design it so 
   he has some knowledge). Test Cases will be entered into Jira with detailed 
   steps and intended result. Devon and Goutham will then decide who does 
   which test cases, then I will show them how to do the test cases, mark them 
   as complete in Jira if there are no issues and list issues if there are any.
